           GPT fdisk (consisting of the gdisk and sgdisk programs) is 
           a text-mode partitioning tool for Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, 
           and Windows that works on Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) 
           Partition Table (GPT) disks, rather than on the more common 
           (through 2009) Master Boot Record (MBR) partition tables.
