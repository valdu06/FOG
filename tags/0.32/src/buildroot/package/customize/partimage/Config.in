	  Partimage is opensource disk backup software. It saves partitions having a supported 
	  filesystem on a sector basis to an image file. Although it runs under Linux, Windows 
	  and most Linux filesystems are supported. The image file can be compressed to save 
	  disk space and transfer time and can be split into multiple files to be copied to 
	  CDs or DVDs.
