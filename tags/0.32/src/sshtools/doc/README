Compiling GSI-SSHTerminal
-------------------------

In all cases you must set your $JAVA_HOME correctly to the installation 
directory of your Java installation.  Your Java installation must be Java 
SDK 1.5 or greater.

The GSI-SSHTerminal is compiled through the use of the "make" script, in the 
sshtools directory run:

	Linux
		./make.sh
	Windows
		make.bat

this will create the GSI-SSHTerminal application in 
"release/GSI-SSHTerm-<version>" and this can be run using the following:

	Linux
		cd release/GSI-SSHTerm-<version>/bin
		./sshterm.sh

        Windows:
                cd release/GSI-SSHTerm-<version>/bin
                sshterm.bat

To additionally compile the applet version and associated web pages use the 
command (the webpages are highly customised for the NGS webserver and will need
editing before the webpaes are useful):

	Linux:
		./make.sh all
	
	Windows XP:
		make.bat all

To compile in other Windows environments change the os="Windows XP" entry
at about line 207 of build.xml, to the OS name returned by the os.name Java
property on your machine.

This requires you to setup the file password.properties in the base directory 
of the sshtools source, it should contain the following lines:
	keystore=/home/xxx/.keystore
	keystore.alias=theSigningCertificateKeyAlias
	keystore.pass=aLongPrivateKeyPassphrase

Note that it is suggested that the certificate and private key (in a java 
keystore) that is pointed to by the password.properties file is issued by a 
certification authority that the user is likely to already trust and has a 
subject name that describes you or your organisation.  Please be careful about 
the security of the Java keystore and the password.properties file.  This
certificate should explicitly have "Object Signing" set in the X509v3 
extensions.

This will compile the applet version and webpages to release/applet.


The GSI-SSHTerm automatically creates a ~/.globus/certificates directory for 
the user, copying the UK e-Sciece CA's root certificates and signing policy 
files.  This enables the terminal to be used without any pre-setup (except 
Java).  If you wish to distribute a copy of the GSI-SSHTerm with a different 
set of certificates then please change the contents of the 
"sshtools/res/certificates/" directory.  You will then have to re-compile 
from source.

Configuration
=============
build.properties
----------------

In the build.properties file there are three configuration options:

1) build.site this sets the reported build location in the About
box.

2) default.properties.file sets the name of the file in 
sshtools/res/common which should be used as the default.properties
file.  This file is explained in the next section.  

3) version.suffix sets a version suffix to allow different 
configurations to be flagged.

Two examples are configurations are given, one normal and one 
kerberos, in the distribution these correspond to the 
default.properties and default.properties.kerberos properties
files in sshtools/res/common.

Defaults:
---------
At compile-time the file res/common/${default.properties} is included in in the 
distribution and this is read first (if it exists), then the user' preferences
file (~/.sshterm/GSI-SSHTerm.settings), which can over-ride those in the 
res/common/default.properties file.  

These files are standard Java properties files.  The following options are 
useful (with the example of the compiled in default where no settings in
either file exists!):

Authentication Order:
	sshterm.auth.order=param,proxy,cert,other
Options here are:
	param   - proxy included in <PARAM> tag on applet's webpage
	proxy   - grid proxy stored on disk
	cert    - usercert.pem/userkey.pem
	other   - dialog box with MyProxy, PKCS12 and Browser options
	browser - certificate from web browser
	krb     - Kerberos enabled MyProxy server (must be enabled - see below)
GSI-SSHTerm will cycle through these options, it will not try any other ones that are not in the list.

Default MyProxy server:
	sshterm.myproxy.defaults.hostname=myproxy.grid-support.ac.uk

MyProxy port:
	sshterm.myproxy.defaults.port=7512

*MyProxy username:
	sshterm.myproxy.defaults.username=<value of user.name>

Enable/Disable Kerberos-enabled MyProxy support:
	sshterm.krb5myproxy.enabled=false

Kerberos-enabled MyProxy server hostname:
	sshterm.krb5myproxy.hostname=myproxy-sso.grid-support.ac.uk

Kerberos-enabled MyProxy server port (not configurable in GUI):
	sshterm.krb5myproxy.port=7513

Kerberos KDC:
	sshterm.krb5myproxy.kdc=<value of $USERDNSDOMAIN>

Kerberos Realm:
	sshterm.krb5myproxy.realm=<value of $USERDNSDOMAIN>

*Kerberos Username:
	sshterm.krb5myproxy.username=<value of user.name>

*Default PKCS12 filename:
	sshterm.pkcs12.defaults.file=<No defualt value>

*Browser Profile to choose:
	sshterm.browser.profile=<No defualt value>
Note that if tehre is only one profile it will always be chosen.

*Browser DN to choose:
	sshterm.browser.dn=<No defualt value>
Note that if tehre is only one DN it will always be chosen.

Proxy type:
	sshterm.proxyType=prerfc
This can take the values: rfc, prerfc and legacy

Proxy Liftime:
	sshterm.proxyLength=12
This can take any value between 1 and 240 hours.

Delegation type:
	sssherm.delegationType=full
This can take the values full, limited and none

Proxy saving: this setting sets whether proxies created from Grid
	credentials are saved into the defualt proxy location for future use:
	
	sshterm.proxy.save=false

X Forwarding:
	sshterm.xForwarding=true

Default connection ports: there are two configuration options here:
	sshterm.simple.connection.port=2222
		Sets the port that is used in the quick connection 
		dialog box, and the first ever port value in the
		advanced connection dialog box.
	apps.connection.lastPort=2222 (user's preferences)
		This is the last port number entered by the user in the
		advanced dialog box.  It is overwritten by the terminal
		(application only) each time it is shut down.  It is 
		NOT used in the simple connection dialog box.

Similarly there are last username and last host (apps.connection.lastHost) in
the user's preferences, which is filled in with the last host entered by the 
user in both connection dialog boxes.		

It is recommended that entries marked * are not included in the default.properties
file as these will change depending on the user.
